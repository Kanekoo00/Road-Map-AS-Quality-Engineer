# About me 👋

Hi, my name is Budi and this is my journey to be a Quality Engineer in professional position. I have been a pl/sql developer since 2022 and in early 2025 I started to learn many things to become a Quality Assurance.
Through this page, I'll share everything I've learned through self-study, courses, and projects to improve my skills.
let's see how far I can reach the goals 😄.
