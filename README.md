# About me 👋

Hi, my name is Budi Octaviandy — and this is my journey to becoming a Quality Engineer in a professional environment.

I started my career as a PL/SQL Developer in 2022, and in early 2025 I decided to transition into Quality Assurance. Through this repository, I document everything I learn — from manual testing fundamentals to automation skills — through self-study, hands-on projects, and continuous improvement.

My goal is to build strong technical and analytical skills as a future QA Engineer — ensuring product quality, usability, and reliability.

🚀 Let’s see how far I can go!
